# COSCon 2020 Workshop üî®: _TypeScript compiler 101_

> üöß This Repo is still work in progress! Don't fork it or "use this template", otherwise you need to follow the upstream (here) change manually.

Hello! Welcome to the COSCon 2020 Workshop, _TypeScript Compiler 101_ üéâ. In this Workshop, you'll learn how to use TypeScript Compiler API and how to write a transformer.

‚ö†Ô∏è This is not a introduction to TypeScript. You must know how to code in TypeScript before the workshop.

Note: If you don't know the difference between `Statement` and `Expression`, this workshop is too hard for you.
