# COSCon 2020 Workshop üî®: _TypeScript compiler 101_

Hello! Welcome to the [COSCon 2020][1] Workshop, _**TypeScript Compiler 101**_ üéâ. In this Workshop, you'll learn how to use [TypeScript][2] Compiler API and how to write a transformer.

‚ö†Ô∏è This is not an introduction to TypeScript. You must know how to code in TypeScript before the workshop.

Note: If you don't know the difference between `Statement` and `Expression`, this workshop is too hard for you.
